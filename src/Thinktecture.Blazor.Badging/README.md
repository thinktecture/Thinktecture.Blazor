⚠️ **This package is deprecated and will no longer receive updates.**

We recommend migrating to the new package, [PatrickJahr.Badging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PatrickJahr.Blazor.Badging/), which offers improved features and better compatibility with the latest Blazor versions.

## Introduction

A Blazor wrapper for the [Badging API](https://w3c.github.io/badging/).

The Badging API allows you to display a badge on the installed application’s icon.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You need .NET 7.0 or newer to use this library.

[Download .NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)

### Platform support

[Platform support for Badging API](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_navigator_setappbadge)

### Installation

You can install the package via NuGet with the Package Manager in your IDE or alternatively using the command line:

```
dotnet add package Thinktecture.Blazor.Badging
```

## Usage

The package can be used in Blazor WebAssembly projects.

### Add to service collection

To make the BadgingService available on all pages, register it at the IServiceCollection in `Program.cs` before the host is built:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddBadgingService();
```

### Checking for browser support

Before using the Badging API, you should first test if the API is supported on the target platform by calling the `IsSupportedAsync()` method.
This method returns a boolean to indicate whether the Badging API is supported or not.

```csharp
var isSupported = await badgingService.IsSupportedAsync();
if (isSupported)
{
    // enable badging feature
}
else
{
    // use fallback mechanism or hide/disable feature
}
```

Internally, this method tests for the presence of the `setAppBadge()` and `clearAppBadge()` methods on the `navigator` object of the target browser.

### Set app badge

The `SetAppBadgeAsync()` method sets a badge on the current app's icon.
If a value is passed to this method, it will be set as the value of the badge:

```csharp
await badgingService.SetAppBadgeAsync(3);
```

When omitting the `contents` parameter, a generic badge will be shown, as defined by the platform.

```csharp
await badgingService.SetAppBadgeAsync();
```

### Clear app badge

The `ClearAppBadgeAsync()` method clears the badge on the current app's icon:

```csharp
await badgingService.ClearAppBadgeAsync();
```
