⚠️ **This package is deprecated and will no longer receive updates.**

We recommend migrating to the new package, [PatrickJahr.ScreenWakeLock](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PatrickJahr.Blazor.ScreenWakeLock/), which offers improved features and better compatibility with the latest Blazor versions.

## Introduction

A Blazor wrapper for the [Screen Wake Lock API](https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-wake-lock/).

The Screen Wake Lock API allows web applications to request a screen wake lock. Under the right conditions, and if allowed, the screen wake lock prevents the system from turning off a device's screen.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You need .NET 7.0 or newer to use this library.

[Download .NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)

### Platform support

[![Platform support for Screen Wake Lock API](https://caniuse.bitsofco.de/image/wake-lock.png)](https://caniuse.com/?search=wake-lock)

### Installation

You can install the package via NuGet with the Package Manager in your IDE or alternatively using the command line:

```
dotnet add package Thinktecture.Blazor.ScreenWakeLock
```

## Usage

The package can be used in Blazor WebAssembly projects.

### Add to service collection

To make the ScreenWakeLockService available on all pages, register it at the IServiceCollection in `Program.cs` before the host is built:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScreenWakeLockService();
```

### Checking for browser support

Before using the Screen Wake Lock API, you should first test if the API is supported on the target platform by calling the `IsSupportedAsync()` method.
This method returns a boolean to indicate whether the Screen Wake Lock API is supported or not.

```csharp
var isSupported = await screenWakeLock.IsSupportedAsync();
if (isSupported)
{
    // enable screen wake lock feature
}
else
{
    // use fallback mechanism or hide/disable feature
}
```

### Request screen wake lock

To request a screen wake lock, you need to call the `RequestWakeLockAsync()` method from the `IScreenWakeLockService` service.
The browser can refuse the request for various reasons (for example, because the battery charge level is too low),
so it's a good practice to wrap the call in a `try…catch` statement.
The exception's message will contain more details in case of failure.

```csharp
try
{
    await _screenWakeLockService.RequestWakeLockAsync();
}
catch(Exception e)
{
    // Handle exxception
}
```

### Release screen wake lock

You also need a way to release the screen wake lock, which is achieved by calling the `ReleaseWakeLockAsync()` method of the `IScreenWakeLockService` service.

```csharp
await _screenWakeLockService.ReleaseWakeLockAsync();
```

As soon as the object was released the action `WakeLockReleased` will be fired.

```csharp
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    //...

    _screenWakeLockService.WakeLockReleased = () =>
    {
       _wakeLockRequested = false;
    };

    //...
    await base.OnInitializedAsync();
}
```
